## DIAGRAM

##BRANCHING STRATEGIES
I will be using a git flow branching strategies throught all my projects.
git flow goes like this.
The main idea behind the Git flow branching strategy is to isolate your work into different types of branches. There are five different branch types in total:

Main
Develop
Feature
Release
Hotfix
The two primary branches in Git flow are main and develop. There are three types of supporting branches with different intended purposes: feature, release, and hotfix.

##USES OF GITIGNORE FILE
gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository. gitignore is located in the root directory of your repo. / will ignore directories with the name.

gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project. A local . gitignore file is usually placed in the root directory of a project. You can also create a global .

## Storage of credentials and sensitive informations

i will be storing my credentials on the .gitignore file since they are all sensitive and I cannot share the with everyone else.
