## BRANCHING STRATEGIES
I will be using a git flow branching strategies throught all my projects.
git flow goes like this.
The main idea behind the Git flow branching strategy is to isolate your work into different types of branches. There are five different branch types in total:

Main
Develop
Feature
Release
Hotfix
The two primary branches in Git flow are main and develop. There are three types of supporting branches with different intended purposes: feature, release, and hotfix.
